# Setup

`python3 -m virtualenv venv` -- to create the virtual environment


`source venv/bin/activate` -- if you plan to run the app, you should know what it does ;)


Assuming you have python3.7+ in venv, and pip3 is the default pip:

`pip install -r requirements.txt`


Feel free to run `python app.py` now.
